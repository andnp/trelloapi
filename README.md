This is a node library that allows a user easy access to the Trello public API.

To use this library you need to have an ```accesskeys.json``` file in the project's root directory. For example:
```
{
	"trello":{
		"accesskey": "j38ls0ajh129hd8sh3s8eha9d",
		"secret": "asjd7i3j2haf91j9saha9u329e98sahd9dfh2u39dsafh223us9sdjha39jake8ds",
		"token": "mcnam2m1aza9djb9ax8ahqo1h9acbn19ac9an1b0ajkcnk19cbzbnm1v100askd9ah"
	}
}
```
